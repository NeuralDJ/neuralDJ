# Dj Neuromancer
## Why
Humans are good at noticing emotions,  
but is it possible to recognize 500+ emotions  
in real time and make the right analysis?

## What
DJ Neuromancer plays personlaized music depending on the setting (party,wedding) and changes song depending on the reception/emotion of the audience towards the song in real time. In gist, DJ Neuromancer will help play the right music at the right time and keep the audience engaged.

## How
1. Video Input  
The video stream processes frames from any camera feed.
							
2. Getting Started  
Age, gender and room setting determine the starting song, then the emotion either changes or keeps the genre.
										
3. Emotion Driven  
The features are sent to Spotify, where the song will change depending on reception to music.
							
4. Intelligent Selection  
Over time, we get smarter to learn song preferences from video feed to personalize even better.


## Post Hackathon Help?
hey , like Vikas suggested. Add the areas (files) you worked on so that if anyone has any trouble merging or running into an exception we can just contact that person directly.

### Tiago
I worked on almost all the files and I feel like I could help on any one with anything.  
To just scope down. Here are the areas I am more confortable with:
1. Spotify web api calls (oauth to some level)
1. Any of the javascript files under the frontend/public/js folder
1. app_server.py, feed.py, emotion.py

### Vikas

I worked on the entire backend folder and I can exactly pinpoint help in any of the files - 
analytics.py,app_server.py,azurevision.py,decisionmaker.py,emotion.py,
getCameraFeedProto.py,webcamtoemotion.py,feed.py
